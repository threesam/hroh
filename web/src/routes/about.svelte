        <h1 class="biggerH">Hard Road Of Hope</h1>
        <p>West Virginia...that's just like the epicenter of the opioid problem, right? And home to a bunch of
            hillbillies who vote for Trump? And the totally corrupt politicians who just let coal and gas do
            whatever the hell they want? What could you possibly have to say about West Virginia that's worth
            hearing?</p><br>
        <p>These are some of the questions I've gotten from people when I told them I'm doing a longer-form
            piece on West Virginia. Heads cocked to the side like confused dogs, they emphatically demand that
            they already know what it's about, already know the stories, the characters (whom they don't like), so
            why bother? I might as well do a piece on why slavery was bad or how the earth isn't flat.</p><br>
        <p>Ironically of course, they've answered their questions by asking them. Folks hear a lot, but they know a
            lot less. And hey, that included me too. Coal mining, then fracking, trailer parks and people with giant
            Trump flags in their yards. That's it, right? Truly, scathing headlines and punch lines about West
            Virginia are a dime a dozen. And the forgotten and isolated rednecks of West Virginia are familiar with
            this attitude. Indeed, it goes back to the very founding of the state as a throwaway resource colony.
        </p><br>
        <p>So, there you have it. This is worth hearing because few so far have bothered listening. And this failure
            not only discards people and places in a manner corporate execs would applaud, it amputates us from
            our shared history, the understanding of our present and the ability to shape the future.
            Yes, West Virginia is home to pain, suffering, oppression, corruption and bigotry – but so is the whole
            country. And more than a microcosm of our agony, West Virginia is an example of radical resolve.
            Proud rednecks, the people are still fighting and building in the hills and hollers; working to connect
            their past to a broken present and the potential future that we all share.
            It's a hard road of hope, a pot-holed and puddled path past the Kings of coal and gas, but they keep
            walking. We would do well to walk with them for a while – and listen.</p><br>

        <!-- <h3>Hard Road Of Hope</h3> -->
        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>“It's hard to win around here, it really is,” says Lynn Beatty, a resident of Doddridge County, the
            epicenter of the fracking boom in West Virginia. A neighbor, Linda Ireland echoes that sentiment:
            “You feel like there's nothing you can do. Because you have these gas companies with all their
            resources. And the state seems to be on their side as well.”</p><br>
        <p>Once the home to the rise and reign of King Coal, West Virginia is now in the crosshairs of a transition
            of power: from coal to gas. In the midst of this ecologically violent shift, communities are being
            ripped
            apart physically, economically and emotionally. The third poorest state in the nation, Paul Corbit
            Brown, president of Keepers of the Mountain explains the situation. “People here feel very isolated,
            they feel very forgotten. They feel very neglected, abandoned, abused – and hungry. For more than just
            food.” It's no surprise then that West Virginia is ranked number one in the opioid crisis. It's not
            surprising that forgotten folks have latched on to the lies and propaganda peddled by the likes of
            Trump.</p><br>
        <p>What is surprising, however, is how much we could learn from West Virginia. Known by many, even
            inside the state, as a throwaway resource colony filled with nothing but hillbillies and poisoned
            streams
            and coal ash, these hills and hollers have a lot to show us about people power, resilience, beauty and
            indeed, ourselves. More than a microcosm of corporate malfeasance, bad policies and extremist
            propaganda, West Virginia is home to a radical working class history and the hard work of hoping for
            and building a better future.
        </p><br>
        <p>Purposefully buried and now being dug up and amplified by grassroots activists, this history speaks to
            the power of the working class coming together – across cultural, race and religious dividing lines to
            organize together for basic human rights. From the sweeping and majestic hills of Southern Appalachia
            to the methane-streaked highways of the fracking corridor; from the decapitated peaks to the winding
            holler roads, this is a story most don't ever hear: a story truly of, for and by the people.</p><br>
        <p>“Hard Road of Hope” amplifies the voices of these forgotten and proud rednecks – the ones carrying
            the torch from the first rednecks who tied on red bandanas and marched for their basic human rights. It
            seeks to hold a mirror up to all sacrifice zones, to the isolated folks in pain across the nation. This is an
            American story, an American history – and for the future of all the people who call this place home,
            this is the path we must all walk if we want to thrive, and indeed, survive.</p><br>
